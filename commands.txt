Bangladesh, located in South Asia on the Bay of Bengal, is bordered by India to the west, north, and east, and Myanmar to the southeast. Dhaka, the capital and largest city, serves as the country's economic, political, and cultural hub. Known for its rich cultural heritage, Bangladesh boasts a vibrant tradition in music, dance, and literature, with Bengali as its official language. The country gained independence from Pakistan in 1971, a milestone celebrated annually on Independence Day, March 26. The Padma, Jamuna, and Meghna rivers create a complex delta system, making the country susceptible to flooding. The Sundarbans, home to the endangered Bengal tiger, is the largest mangrove forest in the world. Bangladesh’s textile industry is a key economic driver, producing a significant portion of the world’s ready-made garments. With a tropical monsoon climate, the country experiences heavy rainfall from June to October. Cox's Bazar features one of the world’s longest natural sea beaches, stretching over 120 kilometers. The cuisine is renowned for its dishes like biriyani, hilsa fish curry, and pithas. The Royal Bengal Tiger, an iconic species, inhabits the Sundarbans. The nation has made strides in education and public health, improving literacy and maternal health. Traditional village fairs and festivals celebrate local culture, and despite various challenges, Bangladesh is recognized for its remarkable economic growth and resilience.
