# SumBERT: A Text Summarization Flask App

**Overview**

The **SumBERT: A Text Summarization Flask App** is an intuitive platform that allows users to input documents or articles and receive concise summaries. Leveraging advanced **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques, the app processes the input, extracts key points, and provides a shortened, meaningful summary. This tool is perfect for users who want a quick overview of lengthy content without missing important details.

**Key Features**

- **Text Input:** Users can input text directly in English.
- **Automatic Summarization:** The app uses state-of-the-art algorithm to analyze and generate a summary, significantly reducing the length of the original content.
- **Summarization Model:** Powered by the **BERTSUM** model, specifically designed for text summarization tasks, the app ensures high accuracy, coherence, and relevance in the generated summaries.
- **Word Count Display:** The app automatically counts and displays both the original text's word length and the summary's word length, allowing users to gauge the level of condensation.
- **Real-Time Summarization:** Users can instantly see the summary after inputting the text and initiating the process.
- **Customizable Summary Length:** Adjust the length of the summary based on your preferences for a more concise or detailed output.

**How BERTSUM Summarizes Text**

The **BERTSUM** model is a specialized variant of **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)** that is tailored for extractive summarization. It works by:
- **Understanding Context:** BERTSUM first analyzes the entire input text to capture the context and relationships between sentences.
- **Scoring Sentences:** The model scores each sentence based on its relevance to the overall content.
- **Extracting Key Sentences:** The top-scoring sentences are selected and assembled to form a coherent, concise summary that retains the most critical information from the original document.
- **Ensuring Coherence:** Thanks to BERTSUM’s sophisticated understanding of language, the generated summaries maintain a logical flow, making them easy to read.

**Tech Stack**

- **Python:** The core functionality of the app is built using Python, offering versatility and scalability.
- **Flask:** The lightweight Flask framework is used to handle web requests, ensuring fast and efficient performance.
- **Netlify:** The application is deployed on Netlify, offering seamless scalability, fast deployment, and easy management.

**Installation Guide**

To set up the **Text Summarization Flask App** locally, follow these steps:
- **Clone the Repository**
  
  git clone  https://github.com/shibbir282/BERTSUM-Based-Text-Summarization-Web-App.git

- Install Dependencies Set up your Python environment by installing the required dependencies:
  
  pip install -r requirements.txt

- Configure the Application Update any required settings, such as API keys or external services, as specified in the configuration files.
- Run the Application Start the Flask development server:
  
  python app.py
  
- Access the App Open your web browser and go to the generated link as like as follows:
  
  http://127.0.0.1:5000/

**Usage Instructions**

- Input Text: Use the web interface to paste text documents in supported formats.
- Summarization: Click the "Generate Summary" button to initiate the process. The app will automatically analyze the text using BERTSUM model and generate a summary.
- View Word Counts: The app will display the original text's word count alongside the summary's word count, helping you see how much the text was condensed.
- Download or Share: If supported, users can download the summary or share it directly from the interface.
- Experiment: Try different input texts, summary lengths, and even other languages to explore the app’s capabilities.

**Contributions**

We welcome contributions! If you'd like to improve this project, feel free to fork the repository, create a new branch, and submit a pull request. You can also raise issues for any bugs or feature requests you'd like to discuss.

**Acknowledgements**

A big thank you to the open-source community and contributors for their valuable tools, libraries, and resources. This project wouldn't have been possible without their ongoing efforts and innovation in the field of Natural Language Processing.

**Future Enhancements**

- **Abstractive Summarization:** Introduce abstractive summarization capabilities for more dynamic summaries that rephrase content instead of just extracting sentences.
- **Multi-Language Support:** Expand the app to summarize texts in multiple languages.
- **User Authentication:** Add user login to save past summaries for future reference
- **API Integration:** Develop an API for integrating summarization services into other applications.

**Conclusion**

The SumBERT: A Text Summarization Flask App offers an easy-to-use, reliable solution for summarizing lengthy texts. With features like customizable summary length, real-time results, and word count displays, this tool is perfect for users looking for quick insights from long documents. It’s an excellent example of cutting-edge NLP in action, demonstrating the potential of models like BERTSUM in modern applications.
